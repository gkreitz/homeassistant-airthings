# Airthings Wave Plus Environment Sensor for Home Assistant

This was developed by [@gkreitz](https://github.com/gkreitz) and forked from (https://github.com/gkreitz/homeassistant-airthings)

Quick n' dirty hack to get [Airthings Wave Plus](https://amazon.com/Airthings-2930-Quality-Detection-Dashboard/dp/B07JB8QWH6?tag=rynoshark-20) indoor air quality sensors into Home Assistant.

**Beware, very untested. Only works with Airthings Wave Plus.**

I wanted something to read my Airthings Wave Plus, so I built this. Far from production quality. Magic hardcoded constants. Reads data the wrong way to work around a bug. Tested on a single device. Only supports a single Wave Plus. Does not construct a unique id for the sensor. Figured I may as well upload in case it's useful to someone else.

## Installation

1. Find out the MAC address of your Airthings Wave Plus. See https://airthings.com/us/raspberry-pi/ for how to find MAC address.
1. This fork made for intergation through HACS.
1. Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` (or modify your `sensor` heading, if you already have one):

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: airthings_wave_plus
    mac: 00:11:22:AA:BB:CC # replace with MAC of your Airthings Wave+
```

Then restart Home Assistant and if everything works, you'll have some new sensors named `sensor.airthings_{co2,humidity,longterm_radon,pressure,shortterm_radon,temperature,voc}`
